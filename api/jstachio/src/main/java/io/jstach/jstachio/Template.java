	 * arrays.
	 * <p>
	 * The passed in {@link OutputStream} <em>will only have

	 * can be accumulated to support almost zero-copy. <strong> Consequently absolutely no
	 * mutation of the byte arrays should happen as they could be reusable static parts of
	 * the template! </strong>

	 * intimate knowledge of how your platform buffers data and have byte like access as
	 * current JMH benchmarking indicates that
	 * {@link String#getBytes(java.nio.charset.Charset)} is generally much faster for raw
	 * byte conversion albeit at the possible cost of increased memory. One should peform
	 * their own benchmarking to confirm using this interface is worth it. </em>
