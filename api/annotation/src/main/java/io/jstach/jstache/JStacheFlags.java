/**
 * Compiler flags that are subject to change. Use at your own risk.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Flags maybe added without a major version change unlike the rest of the
 * API.</strong>
 * <p>
 * Order of flag lookup and precedence is as follows:
 * <ol>
 * <li>type annotated with JStache and this annotation.
 * <li>enclosing class (of type annotated with JStache) with this annotation with inner to
 * outer order.
 * <li>package annotated with this annotation.
 * <li>module annotated with this annotation.
 * <li>annotation processor compiler arg options (<code>-A</code>). The flags are
 * lowercased and prefixed with "<code>jstache.</code>"</li>
 * </ol>
 * <em>The flags are NOT combined but rather the first found dictates the flags set or not
 * (including empty)</em>
 *
 * @author agentgt
 * @apiNote the retention policy is purposely {@link RetentionPolicy#SOURCE} as these
 * flags only impact compiling of the template.

		/**
		 * <strong>EXPERIMENTAL:</strong> Normally falsey is either empty list, boolean
		 * false, or <code>null</code>. This flag disables <code>null</code> as a falsey
		 * check.
		 *
		 * For example when opening a section like: <pre><code class="language-hbs">
		 * {{#myNonNull}}
		 * Hi!
		 * {{/myNonNull}}
		 * </code> </pre>
		 *
		 * JStachio would produce code that checks if <code>myNonNull</code> is null as
		 * well as iterate if it is a list or check if true if it is a boolean.
		 *
		 * <p>
		 * However null checking will still be done if JStachio can find a
		 * {@link ElementType#TYPE_USE} annotation with the {@link Class#getSimpleName()}
		 * of <code>Nullable</code> on the type that is being accessed as a section. This
		 * follows <a href="https://github.com/jspecify/jspecify">JSpecify rules</a> but
		 * not other nullable annotations like
		 * <a href="https://spotbugs.github.io/">SpotBugs</a> that are not
		 * {@link ElementType#TYPE_USE}.
		 *
		 * <h4>Benefits</h4>
		 *
		 * The advantages of disabling null checking are:
		 * <ul>
		 * <li>Failing fast instead of just not rendering something which may make finding
		 * bugs easier.</li>
		 * <li>Less generated code which maybe easier to read</li>
		 * <li>Avoid warnings of superfluous null checking by static analysis tools</li>
		 * <li>Possible slight improvement of performance</li>
		 * </ul>
		 *
		 * <h4>Caveats</h4>
		 *
		 * <h5>JDK Bug</h5> Because of JDK bug:
		 * <a href="https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8225377">JDK-8225377</a> this
		 * <em>nullable detection will only work if the type that is being checked is
		 * currently within the same compile boundary as the JStache model being
		 * analyzed!</em>
		 *
		 * <h5>Manually checking for null</h5> If JStachio cannot detect that the type is
		 * nullable because it is not annotated or because of the aforementioned JDK bug
		 * then it will conclude that it can never be null and thus you will be unable to
		 * use section like conditions to check if is null. One workaround is to use a
		 * custom {@link JStacheLambda} to check for null.
		 *
		 * @apiNote This is currently experimental and a flag because of the JDK bug. In
		 * the future more comprehensive support will be put in {@link JStacheConfig}.
